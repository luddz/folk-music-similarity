# Mean and variance
This folder contains the mean and variance

Need to be used with python 2.

The file _song.py_ is a class, not really used, and the main file is _main.py_ where most of the code is. Here is where different lines of code need to be uncommented.  

The file _fastRNN.py_ is a modified version of _sample-rnn-fast.py_ and the model _config5-wrepeats-20160112-222521.pkl_ (same one used for generating the data) comes from https://github.com/IraKorshunova/folk-rnn.
